Dotfiles
========

Configurations for all!

Here are some of my dotfiles. They are structured so that abc.symlink
should be linked to ~/.abc. Some are directories, some are just files.
Some are used on one computer, some on another. Feel free to fork and
use - I tried to include references for where, exactly, each setting
originally came from, so you should be able to find some info.
